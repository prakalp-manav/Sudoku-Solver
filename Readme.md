## Introduction

This Sudoku solver is designed to solve Sudoku puzzles using the Char74k dataset instead of the more commonly used MNIST dataset. The Char74k dataset consists of characters extracted from natural images, including digits 0-9.

## Dependencies

Python 3.12
NumPy
OpenCV
TensorFlow

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run Work.py

## Dataset

The Char74k dataset contains images of handwritten characters, including digits 0-9. It was collected from natural images and can be used for tasks such as character recognition.

## Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by the need for a Sudoku solver that can handle printed puzzles rather than handwritten ones. The use of the Char74k dataset provides a suitable alternative to MNIST for digit recognition in this context.
